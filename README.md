# Amherst-History

This project was done by Nicole Frontero and Sabir Meah for STAT-495 Advanced Data Analysis at Amherst College during the fall of 2020.  The objective of this project was to analyze text from the book *History of Amherst College during the First Half Century* and to see what sort of insights we could glean about the text through our analyses. 

In order to run the code within the document `history_report`, make sure that your working directory is set to our repo `history-history2`. 

Note that for this project, we consulted a lab that Sabir had done in STAT-231 Data Science in fall 2019 (with Professor Kat Correia).
