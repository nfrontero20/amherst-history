# Amherst-History

I worked with a peer in STAT-495 Advanced Data Analysis (taken in fall 2020) to analyze the text found in [History of Amherst College During Its First Half Century, 1821-1871](https://archive.org/details/historyofamherst00tyleiala/page/14/mode/2up) by William Seymour Tyler.

We shared our findings in a pdf report titled ["Amherst History Report"](https://github.com/nfrontero20/amherst-history/blob/master/report/report.pdf) (the Rmd can be found [here](https://github.com/nfrontero20/amherst-history/blob/master/report/report.Rmd)).
